Operating Performance

Mno 	0.82 Mach Normal Operating Speed 
Mmo 	0.86 Mach Max. Operating Speed 
Mne 	0.93 Mach Never Exceed Speed 
Vno 	330 knots Normal Operating Speed IAS

Vne 	380 knots Never Exceed Speed IAS 
Vap		136 – 155 knots (based on total weight) @ Max Flaps/Gears Down
Vtd		125 – 142 knots (based on total weight)

DO NOT EXCEED 250 KTS AT OR BELOW 10,000 FT ALTITUDE

Take-off Speed @ MTOW

V1 (Decision Speed) - 	140 knots @ Flaps 2 or 3
VR (Rotation Speed) - 	145 knots
V2 (Safety Speed) - 	155 knots

Cruise Speed

Max Cruise Speed (GS) is 500 kts @ FL300 – FL350 depending on weight
Typical Cruise Mach is 0.78M – 0.82M @ FL300 – FL350
Long Range Cruise is 465 kts (GS)  @ FL350

ILS & Appraoch Speed @ MLW

180 kts Flaps 2 to 136 – 155 knots Full Flaps/Gear Down
Vapp = 1.3 x Vso (Stall Speed)


Important Cruise Notes

When flying long routes (over 4hrs) with MTOW, climb to FL300 & hold Alt with cruise speed 0.78 - 0.80 Mach , then fly that level for 30-45 min. then climb to FL310 - 320 @500 fpm and so on until you reach FL350 @ 0.80 - 0.82 Mach.

Try not exceed 91% N1 during cruise in order to have available thrust for emergencies & be more efficient with fuel burn.

FAA Field Lengths

Take-off Runway Length	8,700 ft to 9,000 ft
Landing Runway Length	5,500 ft to 6,000 ft

Flaps and Gears Extension Speeds

Flaps 1				240 knots
Flaps 2 + Slats		215 knots
Flaps 3 + Slats		196 knots
Flaps 4 + Gears		186 knots
Max. Gear Ext.		210 knots

ETOPS Extended Twin-Engine Operations

If an engine failure occur during cruise forcing an engine shutdown, fly a descend profile on the remaining engine to FL160 (16,000ft) & hold speed between 300 - 420kts. Do not forget to trim to compensate for your lost engine. The A330 can fly the remaining trip on one engine & land @ MLW or lower.

The Airbus A330 is fitted with engines certified ETOPS for 90 , 120 & 180 minutes.
